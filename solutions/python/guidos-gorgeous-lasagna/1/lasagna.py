    Parameters:
        number_of_layers (int): The number of layers in the lasagna.
        elapsed_bake_time (int): Time the lasagna has been baking in the oven.
    
    Returns:
        int: The total time elapsed (in minutes) preparing and baking.

# To avoid the use of magic numbers (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)), you should define a PREPARATION_TIME constant.
# You can do that on the line below the 'EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME' constant.
# This will make it easier to do calculations, and make changes to your code.
